Python and R resources for beginners...
=======================================

...with special regards to science and data analysis applications, visualization and graphics
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here you find a list of useful resources for learning Python or R, as
well as a virtual environment where many tools are readily available for
you. You will find this collection helpful either if you are a scientist
and you just realized that you need computational tools for processing
your data, or you already have done it for a while but looking for new
tools and alternatives, or you just would like to start learning Python
or R for any other purpose.

Setting up a Python environment
-------------------------------

This repo contains a virtual environment set up for easy installation.
You can start using Python without learning how to install Python and
modules, which is not always straightforward and might even require some
system administration knowledge. Of course later you can learn these,
but now we provide a little help for a quick start. To install this
environment to your own computer follow [the
description](https://github.com/deeenes/bioinfo-tools/tree/master/JupyterEnv).

Where to start?
---------------

-   https://www.python.org/ - The home of Python
-   http://stackoverflow.com/documentation/python/topics - In 2016
    StackOverflow started their Documentation project, which aims to be
    a community developed schoolbook and knowledgebase. This rapidly
    developed to one of the best Python learning resources on the web.
-   https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python - Interactive platform to
    learn Python (as well as many other languages). Start here if you
    have never wrote code before.
-   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBxCHonP6Ro&list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGAcbMi1sH6oAMk4JHw91mC\_ -
    Long Python video tutorial for the very beginners
-   https://github.com/mshang/python-elevator-challenge - Beginner
    tutorial with programming an elevator in Python

Non Python specific but important resources
-------------------------------------------

-   http://stackoverflow.com/ - This very important resource worths
    special mention. As you will se if you google for any programming
    issue, in 90% you will end up on this site. SO is a Q&A (question
    and answer) site where anybody can ask programming related questions
    and answer or comment others questions. Users collect reputation
    points for their contributions which made it a very efficient
    platform for community building around mutual help. Your question
    likely will be answered very quickly, but be careful not to ask
    something already answered by answers for other questions.
-   https://bitbucket.org/ - We suggest you to familiarize yourself as
    soon as possible with version control frameworks. Nowdays the most
    popular is **git**. Version control helps you to keep track of
    changes, keep your project files in order, backup your work often,
    avoid data loss, to collaborate and to share your code in a standard
    and convenient way. BitBucket allows you to to create more private
    repos than the most well known git server,
    [http://github.com/](github.com).
-   https://maryrosecook.com/blog/post/git-from-the-inside-out - If you
    write code please start using git. Sooner is better, even your
    random exercises you can commit to a git repo. Here is an in depth
    introduction to git starting from the basics.

Interactive learning platforms
------------------------------

-   https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python - Interactive platform to
    learn Python (as well as many other languages)
-   http://www.learnpython.org/ - Lots of tutorials from the basics
-   https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science -
    Interactive tutorial focusing on Data Science applications
-   https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intermediate-python-for-data-science -
    Interactive tutorial focusing on visualization with matplotlib

Exercises
---------

When you write code with the aim of learning it is often difficult to
find a task, you want to code, but don't know what to code. In Euler
Problems you find hundreds of small mathematics problems, each of them
you can solve just in a few lines of code, ideal even if you have only
half hour for practicing. As you develop you can return to already
solved problems, and find out better and nicer implementations.

give an introduction or insight into specific topics 
-   https://julien.danjou.info/blog/tags/Python - Python related articles
    from Julien Danjou's blog. You can find excellent pieces here, for
    example about testing, profiling, exception handling, pep8 standard,
    etc. 
-   https://jakevdp.github.io/ - Interesting insights into specific
    topics.
-   http://seriously.dontusethiscode.com/ - Nice Python tricks from :james.

Online Courses
--------------

-   https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python - A Coursera
    specialization for learning Python

Environments
------------

-   http://www.bpython-interpreter.org/ - Nice, colorful command line
    environment with smart autocompletion and built in help functions.
-   https://gist.github.com/lonetwin/5902720 - You can easily customize
    your Python shell with editing your **~/.pythonrc*-   file. For
    example, copy the one in this git repo into yours, and you will have
    a colored shell with autocompletion.
-   https://www.pythonanywhere.com/ - A full Python environment in the
    cloud with lots of
    [libraries](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/batteries_included/) and
    many Python versions available. You can write Python scripts in the
    browser, and even deploy your application as a webpage. Free plan is
    available.
-   https://jupyter.org/ - Interactive Python environment in the
    browser: Python runs in the background on your machine, and you
    write the code and get the output in the browser, in so called
    notebooks. Note: this is the same as IPython was, they just renamed
    when it became language agnostic (originally it was only for Python,
    but now can be used also with other languages).
-   https://www.continuum.io/why-anaconda - Python environment intended
    for science and data analysis, with easy availability of relevant
    modules (at least in theory: eventually installation might be more
    complicated).

Modules for data analysis
-------------------------

-   http://www.numpy.org/ - Computationally efficient handling of
    multidimensional numeric arrays (i.e. matrices of numbers).
-   https://www.scipy.org/ - Collection of many stats and science
    methods, like regression, statistics tests.
-   http://pandas.pydata.org/ - Built on top of numpy, pandas provides a
    more convenient handling of data tables, i.e. here you can have row
    and column names, methods for convenient rearranging and filtering
    your data. You can imagine a programmable excel sheet, or something
    like data frames in R.
-   https://jupyter.org/ - Interactive Python environment in the
    browser: Python runs in the background on your machine, and you
    write the code and get the output in the browser, in so
    callednotebooks. Note: this is the same as IPython was, they just
    renamed when it became language agnostic (originally it was only for
    Python, but now can be used also with other languages).

    advanced Python programming

Python visualization and plotting
---------------------------------

We have seen a number of efforts emerging in the past years aiming to
provide powerful data visualization in Python, so sciencists and data
analysts would not need to be envy of R users. Perhaps the perfect
ggplot2 or lattice equivalent is still to come (although two very fresh
libraries, Altair and Plotnine are promising), but each of the
frameworks listed below are very good in certain tasks, and of course
have its limitations. Thus, it is difficult to chose a plotting library,
likely you will try more of them.
-   http://matplotlib.org/ - The
    "grandmother of all Python plotting applications", extremely
    customizable, but complex plotting module. Note: you can use matplotlib
    either by its object oriented interface or by the matlab inspired pylab
    interface, be aware of the differences.
-   http://seaborn.pydata.org/ -
    Module built on matplotlib, providing simple methods and nice default
    styles. And you can still access the low level matplotlib interface, in
    case you need it.
-   https://plot.ly/python/ - An easy way to make
    interactive html plots in IPython notebook. Note: it is not obvious from
    their webpage, but you don't need to register even for the free plan to
    use this library locally and generate html plots; you can install by pip
    and use it just like any other module. 
-   http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/ - A plot.ly alternative. 
-   http://lightning-viz.org/ - Similar to the former two. Note, in Python
    you can run lightning without server, just like the other plotting
    libraries. 
-   http://holoviews.org/index.html - Feature rich, data
    driven plotting framework with matplotlib, seaborn and bokeh backends
    and connections to mpld3 and plotly via extensions. 
-   http://pygal.org/en/stable/ - Similar to the 2 above, creates
    interactive plots. 
-   https://mpld3.github.io/index.html - Here you
    create the plots with matplotlib, and transform them to d3.js objects,
    so they remain interactive in the browser, independently from Python. 
-   https://github.com/vega/vega/wiki/Documentation - A generic
    visualization grammar (i.e. a declarative language to describe
    visualizations). 
-   https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/ - A simplified
    version of Vega. 
-   https://vincent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ - A tool
    to define plots in Python and translate them to Vega. 
-   https://altair-viz.github.io/ - A declarative visualization module for
    Python using Vega in the background. 
-   http://vispy.org/gallery.html -
    This creates and renders dynamic visualizations using the graphic card
    of your computer. 
-   http://ggplot.yhathq.com/ - An attempt to make the
    famous R ggplot visualization library available in Python. Does not
    provide all the features and exactly the same interface, but still a
    nice library. 
-   https://github.com/sirrice/pygg - Provides access to R
    ggplot2 from Python. 
-   https://github.com/dgrtwo/gleam - Creates
    interactive visualizations for browser; Python needs to run in the
    background. 
-   https://dansaber.wordpress.com/2016/10/02/a-dramatic-tour-through-pythons-data-visualization-landscape-including-ggplot-and-altair/ - 
    An amusing and detailful comparison of matplotlib, pandas, seaborn,
    ggplot and altair, with 5 examples and analysis. If you want to make an
    informed decision about which library to use, don't skip this. 
-   http://pbpython.com/visualization-tools-1.html - Another overview of
tools, but with less details and less examples.
-   https://lisacharlotterost.github.io/2016/05/17/one-chart-code/ - A wider
but less detailed comparison. 
-   http://matplotlib.org/style\_changes.html - Good material about color
    maps. 
-   https://plotnine.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html - So far
    the most faithful implementation of ggplot2 in Python. A great
    declarative plotting library.

Graphs (networks)
-----------------

-   http://igraph.org/ - Powerful graph analysis package with full
    featured R and Python interface and great visualization module.
-   http://www.data-imaginist.com/2017/Announcing-ggraph/ - A really
    great new module for graph visualization with R ggplot2. It works
    together with igraph: you can use igraph graphs and layouts
    seemlessly.
-   http://sachaepskamp.com/qgraph - Another super R module for graph
    analysis. It extends igraph with additional layouts and methods, and
    they work together very well.
-   https://bitbucket.org/snippets/deeenes/LjL5R/good-fruchterman-reingold-layout -
    Sometimes it is difficult to plot a graph with nodes evenly spaced
    and avoiding overlaps. Here are some good parameters for the
    Fruchterman Reingold layout using qgraph but the resulted layout can
    be used with igraph (sadly in the recent version of R igraph the
    fr\_layout method does not handle these parameters hence we must
    calculate the layout with qgraph).
-   https://graph-tool.skewed.de/ - A high-performance graph library
    with Python interface.
-   https://networkx.github.io/ - A network analysis module written
    purely in Python, recently with more features and better
    visualization.
-   https://pygraphviz.github.io/ - Python interface for
    [graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/), the graph visualization
    library known from its greate layout algorithms.

Alternative network visualizations
----------------------------------

-   http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/linnet/, http://www.hiveplot.net/ - Hive plots
    from Martin Krzywinski: a great alternative to make visible structures
    in large and complex networks
-   http://www.biofabric.org/index.html - Another tool to make visualization
    of complex networks more clear and informative. By William Longabaugh.
-   http://circos.ca/ - A fancy visualization tool from Martin Krzywinski
    to present a connectogram and many other variables in a complex figure.
-   http://circos.ca/documentation/course/ - On the Circos webpage you can
    find a nice course with many complex visualization examples
-   [Arc diagrams](http://www.gastonsanchez.com/visually-enforced/got-plot/how-to/2013/02/02/Arc-Diagrams-in-R-Les-Miserables/)
    from Gaston Sanchez.
-   http://hangingtogether.org/?p=3053 - Sankey diagrams.

Visualization in general
------------------------

-   http://circos.ca/ - A fancy visualization tool from Martin Krzywinski
    to present a connectogram and many other variables in a complex figure
-   http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/brewer/ - Many blog posts, tutorials and
    examples about data visualization from Martin Krzywinski.
-   http://colororacle.org/ - Tool for checking color blind readability
    of figure colors
-   https://personal.sron.nl/~pault/ - Guide for color blind safe
    palettes. Especially see the
    [tech notes](https://personal.sron.nl/~pault/colourschemes.pdf)
-   http://colorbrewer2.org/ - Color palettes from Cynthia Brewer. You
    can access these from R using the
    [`RColorBrewer`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RColorBrewer/)
    package.
-   http://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/ - Many visualization critics
    by Kaiser Fung: he takes a wrong data visualization and shows how it
    could be done better

Other tools for graphics and typography: post processing figures, designing slides, posters and figures, typesetting reports, papers, theses and books
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   http://inkscape.org/ - Inkscape is a professional vector graphics
    editor and a free alternative of Adobe Illustrator. Its default
    format is standard SVG, while you can import and export many other
    formats, for example, of course PDF. Of note, you really should not
    pay \$240 per year for an application to a company only to design
    vector graphics. Nor should you make your institute pay it for you.
    This way you only chain yourself to Adobe and the more time and
    energy you invest in learning to use this sophisticated application
    it just constrain you to keep using it and keep paying for it.
    What's the point in this when an excellent free and open source
    alternative is available? Inkscape is powerful and what you learn
    and achieve using Inkscape remains yours forever.
-   http://gimp.org/ - GIMP stands for GNU Image Manipulation Program.
    Is a professional bitmap graphics editor and a free alternative of
    Adobe Photoshop. What I wrote about Inkscape and Illustrator as
    alternatives completely stands also for GIMP and Photoshop.
-   https://www.latex-project.org/ - LaTeX is the best tool and the
    state of the art standard for scientific typesetting and publishing.
    Created in the 80s by Leslie Lamport, and developed by the
    scientific community with the aim of having a tool which completely
    fits their needs. LaTeX is a free and open source software built on
    top of TeX which has been created by Donald Knuth also addressing
    the needs of scientific typography. The difference is that TeX does
    very basic elementary things in the background, like how to fill a
    line of text with symbols, while LaTeX provides macros for more
    complex tasks, like how to size and position items of a list or
    titles on a page in order to make it look good. I can not say LaTeX
    is an alternative of Adobe InDesign, but for scientific publishing
    it is definitely superior. You can of course use it for typesetting
    fiction books or entertaining journals, but maybe you will have more
    difficulties and if you just want an open source alternative for
    this, there is [Scribus](https://www.scribus.net/). If you need help
    with LaTeX don't go to [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
    but to [its sister site dedicated for
    LaTeX](https://tex.stackexchange.com/). One more important thing:
    you can not simply download and install LaTeX, it comes packaged in
    many different distributions, including different fonts, typesetting
    engines and macro packages. First you should look up which of these
    are available for your operating system. And many templates and
    styles are also available, for example journals used to have their
    own article style, universities their own presentation and thesis
    styles.
-   http://www.texample.net/tikz/examples/ - PGF/TikZ is a LaTeX package
    for creating high quality scientific graphics authored by Till
    Tantau. To find out what kind of graphics, see [the examples in the
    galery](http://www.texample.net/tikz/examples/). If your figure
    involves lots of maths, algebra or needs many alignements and
    positioning TikZ might be useful for you. It is worths to take a
    look on the 1161 pages [user manual of
    TikZ](http://mirrors.ctan.org/graphics/pgf/base/doc/pgfmanual.pdf),
    it is really amazing! Or you can start with the [short
    introduction](http://cremeronline.com/LaTeX/minimaltikz.pdf).
-   https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Beamer\_%28LaTeX%29 - Beamer is a LaTeX
    package for creating presentations. In my opinion for scientific
    presentations it is much better than PowerPoint and Keynote which
    are the most awful applications I have ever seen and I am really
    happy I could completely avoid them in the last 15 years. Also
    Beamer is a free and open source software. Most of the default
    themes look not very nice and old-style, but you can easily modify
    them to have something better looking. See examples
    [here](http://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/~matloff/beamer.html),
    [here](https://sites.google.com/a/wfu.edu/stevenwicker/tech-resources/latex),
    [here](http://deic.uab.es/~iblanes/beamer_gallery/index.html),
    [here](http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~frank/ENG/latex-course/latex-course-3/latex-course-3_en.html),
    [here](http://www.cs.ru.nl/~pim/beamer.php),
    [here](https://www.tjansson.dk/2008/01/presentations-with-latex-beamer-class-ku-style/),
    [here](http://hamaluik.com/posts/better-beamer-themes/) or
    [here](https://github.com/matze/mtheme). If you work at EMBL or in
    the Saez-Rodriguez Group at RWTH Aachen University you can find my
    Beamer theme, slightly modified from PaloAlto, in my git repos
    there: [@EMBL](https://git.embl.de/turei/embl-graphics) or
    [@Aachen](https://github.com/saezlab/graphics). Other notes: the
    final format of your slides will be PDF which is perfectly
    cross-platform. You should check or ask the tech support for the
    aspect ratio of the projector in your lecture room. Prepare
    wide-screen (16:9 or 16:10) slides if those fit as you can have more
    space this way. Also check if your connection can transmit this
    resolution and have an HDMI cable and adapter with you if necessary.
    VGA cables are sometimes limited to 4:3 aspect ratio and 1024x768
    resolution which is quite poor.
-   http://www.texstudio.org/ - TeXstudio is a great editor for LaTeX.
    It comes with autocompletion, built in help, embedded compilation
    tool, PDF viewer and many other handy tools.
-   http://gpick.org/ - Gpick is a nice little color picker and palette
    editor application for Linux by Albertas Vyšniauskas. I use it with
    great satisfaction to create palettes what I use later in R, Python,
    Inkscape, GIMP or whereever else. I don't know about alternatives
    for Mac or Windows but definitely there are.

IDEs (integrated development environments)
------------------------------------------

IDEs help you to keep track of files in your project, their history,
dependencies, testing, outputs, etc.

### Python IDEs

-   https://www.pythonanywhere.com/ - A full Python environment in the cloud
    with lots of [libraries](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/batteries_included/)
    and many Python versions available. You can write Python scripts in the
    browser, and even deploy your application as a webpage. Free plan is
    available.
-   https://www.yhat.com/products/rodeo - Python IDE similar to RStudio,
    focusing on data analysis.
-   https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/ - One of
    the best IDEs for python, with many tools and complex interface 
-   https://www.continuum.io/why-anaconda - Python environment intended for
    science and data analysis, with easy availability of relevant modules

### R IDEs

-   http://rstudio.com/ - Very popular and powerful IDE for R. Built in
    editor, file browser, shell, plot viewer, manual and many other
    helpful tools.

Image processing
----------------

In biology computational analysis of images is often unavoidable. With
high-throughput microscopy you can acquire hundreds of images just in
one hour of time and obviously you can not do all the adjustments and
measurements by hand. Luckily there are a number of easy to use tools
around. You can identify structures and make measurements and finally
come to quantitative data from images. ImageJ is very popular and can
be programmed by its own macro language or many other languages including
Python. But if you want to use Python maybe better to go for Python
image processing modules like scikit-image, OpenCV or ITK.

Regular expression resources
----------------------------

In data analysis we process tremendous amount of data which is sometimes
noisy and we need to extract information from messy patterns. Regular
expressions sooner or later will be your essential tools no matter which
field and language do you work with. Here are a few excellent resources
to learn these small tricky things called regex: 
-   http://rexegg.com/ -
    great, detailful tutorials from beginner to advanced, often with
    interactive demo 
-   http://regular-expressions.info/ - maybe the most
    well known regex page, clear and concise 
-   http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2015/11/18/pythons-hidden-re-gems/ - about
    Python's regex module
