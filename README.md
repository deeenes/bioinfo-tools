# Python and R resources for beginners...

## ...with special regards to science and data analysis applications, visualization and graphics

Here you find a list of useful resources for learning Python or R, as
well as a virtual environment where many tools are readily available for
you. You will find this collection helpful either if you are a scientist
and you just realized that you need computational tools for processing
your data, or you already have done it for a while but looking for new
tools and alternatives, or you just would like to start learning Python
or R for any other purpose.

## Setting up a Python environment

This repo contains a virtual environment created by David Fazekas and set up
for easy installation. It is unmaintained for a couple of years already, I can
not guarantee it works. The idea of this virtual environment is that you can
start using Python without learning how to install Python and modules, which
is not always straightforward and might even require some system
administration knowledge. Of course later you can learn these, but the virtual
environment provides a little help for a quick start. To install this
environment to your own computer follow
[the description](https://github.com/deeenes/bioinfo-tools/tree/master/JupyterEnv).

Alternatively you can install Python and modules the traditional way.
See below.

### General points

-   Python has two major versions available: Python 2 and 3. These are
    incompatible, although it is possible to write code which runs both in
    2 and 3. If you have both of them installed they will reside in their
    own directories and you install modules for them independently.
    It is highly recommended to **use only Python 3** today. Almost all the
    important modules have been already ported to Python 3. Python 2 exists
    only to keep it possible to run old code when it's really necessary. The
    most important science and data analysis modules like `numpy` and `scipy`
    are about to end Python 2 support.
-   On some Linux distributions and Mac OS X still Python 2 is the default.
    Sometimes the `python` command in the shell is a link to either `python2`
    or `python3`. Same stands for `pip`/`pip2`/`pip3`. Check your system
    and be aware where are your `python` and `pip` exacutables and where is
    the `site-packages` or `dist-packages` directory (where the modules
    install).
-   Always know which Python distribution you use and where do you install
    the modules. If you just call `pip install numpy` and then you start
    a Python shell from the Anaconda distribution, don't be surprised if
    `import numpy` gives a `ModuleNotFoundError`. If you are in doubt you can
    find out by `which python` and something like `ls -l /usr/bin/python` and
    similar ways.

### Linux

In Linux distributions you will find up-to-date and well maintained packages
for both Python 2 and 3 and also many modules. One issue is that `pip` and
the distibution's package manager don't know about each other but will
complain if files already exist (because the other package manager installed
them) and won't recognize if a dependency is already installed by the other
manager. Most often I just give the `force` option to overwrite the files.

### Mac OS X

OS X comes with a built-in Python 2. Sometimes this is quite old. Anyways
probably you will want to install an up-to-date Python 3 distribution.
Most convenient is to install a package manager for OS X (most popular is
HomeBrew, another one is MacPorts) and you can use these to install Python 3
and many other modules.

### Python on Windows

Install Python by the provided installer and don't forget to tick the
"include in the path" box. Also you might consider to install cygwin and
git (actually git installer already offers also cygwin). This way you will
have BASH and git which are essential for development. See more about
Windows [here](#windows).

### pip

`pip` is the most often used package manager for Python. If `pip` does not
come with your installation you can install it by `easy_install pip`. Or
by your operating system's package manager.

### Editor

If you are about to start writing code it is important to have a good text
editor. What makes a good text editor is the followings:

-   Syntax highlighting: it automatically colors the different elements of the
    language so it will be easier for you to recognize them and read the code
-   Autocompletion: it automatically offers suggestions to complete words
    while you are typing so you don't need to type of long function or
    variable name more than once
-   Automatic indentation and closing parentheses automatically. These
    features can make writing code even more convenient.
-   Nice color scheme and line numbering: it is important to have a color
    scheme which has appropriate contrast and gentle with your eyes (usually
    dark background color schemes).
-   Line numbering: you must have the lines numbered so you can easily find
    the line blamed by the error message.
-   Search and replace also by regular expressions, go to line key
    combination.

In Linux usually not a problem as the default ones like `gedit` can
be tuned to be quite good. Personally I use
[Kate from KDE](https://kate-editor.org/). For Mac and Windows you need to
install one, for example
[Notepad++ is popular for Windows](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v7.5.8.html),
[TextMate is popular for Mac](https://macromates.com/). Also see the IDEs
listed below and you can consider the new
[JupyterLab](https://blog.jupyter.org/jupyterlab-is-ready-for-users-5a6f039b8906)
which is and IDE in the web browser.

### Anaconda

[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) is a Python and R distribution and
package manager for science and data analysis. They promise standardized
packege management which make collaboration and deployment easier.
Some people like it, I've never used it. For me `pip` and the system's
package manager have been always easy to use and sufficient.

## Where to start?

-   https://www.python.org/ - The home of Python
-   http://stackoverflow.com/documentation/python/topics - In 2016
    StackOverflow started their Documentation project, which aims to be
    a community developed schoolbook and knowledgebase. This rapidly
    developed to one of the best Python learning resources on the web.
-   https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python - Interactive platform to
    learn Python (as well as many other languages). Start here if you
    have never wrote code before.
-   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBxCHonP6Ro&list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGAcbMi1sH6oAMk4JHw91mC\_ -

-   https://github.com/mshang/python-elevator-challenge - Beginner
    tutorial with programming an elevator in Python

## Non Python specific but important resources

-   http://stackoverflow.com/ - This very important resource worths
    special mention. As you will se if you google for any programming
    issue, in 90% you will end up on this site. SO is a Q&A (question
    and answer) site where anybody can ask programming related questions
    and answer or comment others questions. Users collect reputation
    points for their contributions which made it a very efficient
    platform for community building around mutual help. Your question
    likely will be answered very quickly, but be careful not to ask
    something already answered by answers for other questions.
-   https://bitbucket.org/ - We suggest you to familiarize yourself as
    soon as possible with version control frameworks. Nowdays the most
    popular is **git**. Version control helps you to keep track of
    changes, keep your project files in order, backup your work often,
    avoid data loss, to collaborate and to share your code in a standard
    and convenient way. BitBucket allows you to to create more private
    repos than the most well known git server,
    [http://github.com/](github.com).
-   https://maryrosecook.com/blog/post/git-from-the-inside-out - If you
    write code please start using git. Sooner is better, even your
    random exercises you can commit to a git repo. Here is an in depth
    introduction to git starting from the basics from Mary Rose Cook.

## Interactive Python learning platforms

-   https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python - Interactive platform to
    learn Python (as well as many other languages)

-   https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intermediate-python-for-data-science -
    Interactive tutorial focusing on visualization with matplotlib

## Programming exercises

When you write code with the aim of learning it is often difficult to
find a task, you want to code, but don't know what to code. In Euler
Problems you find hundreds of small mathematics problems, each of them
you can solve just in a few lines of code, ideal even if you have only
half hour for practicing. As you develop you can return to already
solved problems, and find out better and nicer implementations.

    browser: Python runs in the background on your machine, and you
    write the code and get the output in the browser, in so called
    notebooks. Note: formerly known as IPython, they just renamed
    when it became language agnostic (originally it was only for Python,
    but now can be used also with other languages, for example R).

    and column names, methods for convenient rearranging and filtering
    your data. You can imagine a programmable excel sheet, or something
    like data frames in R. It's design is not so nice as its R counterpart
    dplyr, also suffers from performance issues. The API is far from being
    intuitive, this great cheatsheet might help a bit:

## Python visualization and plotting

We have seen a number of efforts emerging in the past years with the aim to
provide powerful data visualization in Python, so sciencists and data
analysts would not need to be envy of R user colleagues. Perhaps the perfect
ggplot2 or lattice equivalent is still to come (although two very fresh
libraries, Altair and Plotnine are promising), but each of the
frameworks listed below are very good in certain tasks, and of course
have its limitations. Thus, it is difficult to chose a plotting library,
likely you will try more of them.

-   https://python-graph-gallery.com/ - Collection displaying hundreds of
    charts, always providing the reproducible python code.
-   http://matplotlib.org/ - The
    "grandmother of all Python plotting applications", extremely
    customizable, but complex plotting module. Note: you can use matplotlib
    either by its object oriented interface or by the matlab inspired pylab
    interface, be aware of the differences.
-   https://github.com/rougier/matplotlib-cheatsheet - Similar to the Rstudio
    cheatsheets: great for a quick start with matplotlib and also as a
    reminder during every day work.
-   http://seaborn.pydata.org/ -
    Module built on matplotlib, providing simple methods and nicer default
    styles. And you can still access the low level matplotlib interface, in
    case you need it.
-   http://gureckislab.org/courses/spring20/labincp/chapters/09/00-plots.html -
    Great matplotlib book chapter from the cognition and perception class of
    Todd Gureckis.
-   https://plot.ly/python/ - An easy way to make
    interactive html plots in IPython notebook. Note: it is not obvious from
    their webpage, but you don't need to register even for the free plan to
    use this library locally and generate html plots; you can install by pip
    and use it just like any other module.
-   http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/ - A plot.ly alternative.
-   http://lightning-viz.org/ - Similar to the former two. Note, in Python
    you can run lightning without server, just like the other plotting
    libraries.
-   http://holoviews.org/index.html - Feature rich, data
    driven plotting framework with matplotlib, seaborn and bokeh backends
    and connections to mpld3 and plotly via extensions.
-   http://pygal.org/en/stable/ - Similar to the 2 above, creates
    interactive plots.
-   https://mpld3.github.io/index.html - Here you
    create the plots with matplotlib, and transform them to d3.js objects,
    so they remain interactive in the browser, independently from Python.
-   https://github.com/vega/vega/wiki/Documentation - A generic
    visualization grammar (i.e. a declarative language to describe
    visualizations).
-   https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/ - A simplified
    version of Vega.
-   https://vincent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ - A tool
    to define plots in Python and translate them to Vega.
-   https://altair-viz.github.io/ - A declarative visualization module for
    Python using Vega in the background.
-   http://vispy.org/gallery.html -
    This creates and renders dynamic visualizations using the graphic card
    of your computer.
-   http://ggplot.yhathq.com/ - An attempt to make the
    famous R ggplot visualization library available in Python. Does not
    provide all the features and exactly the same interface, but still a
    nice library.
-   https://github.com/sirrice/pygg - Provides access to R
    ggplot2 from Python.
-   https://github.com/dgrtwo/gleam - Creates
    interactive visualizations for browser; Python needs to run in the
    background.
-   https://dansaber.wordpress.com/2016/10/02/a-dramatic-tour-through-pythons-data-visualization-landscape-including-ggplot-and-altair/ - 
    An amusing and detailful comparison of matplotlib, pandas, seaborn,
    ggplot and altair, with 5 examples and analysis. If you want to make an
    informed decision about which library to use, don't skip this.
-   http://pbpython.com/visualization-tools-1.html - Another overview of
tools, but with less details and less examples.
-   https://lisacharlotterost.github.io/2016/05/17/one-chart-code/ - A wider
but less detailed comparison.
-   http://matplotlib.org/style\_changes.html - Good material about color
    maps.
-   https://plotnine.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html - So far
    the most faithful implementation of ggplot2 in Python. A great
    declarative plotting library.
-   https://e2eml.school/matplotlib_ticks.html - It's often not easy to find
    answers about matplotlib, but these course materials provide a really
    complete guide, with many details you don't find at other places. Here
    I link to one section, but navigating to the course page you can access
    all the further sections (don't click on the links but change the URL
    of the section linked here).

## Graphs (networks)

-   http://igraph.org/ - Powerful graph analysis package with full
    featured R and Python interface and great visualization module.
-   http://www.data-imaginist.com/2017/Announcing-ggraph/ - A really
    great new module for graph visualization with R ggplot2. It works
    together with igraph: you can use igraph graphs and layouts
    seemlessly.
-   http://sachaepskamp.com/qgraph - Another super R module for graph
    analysis from Sacha Epskamp. It extends igraph with additional layouts and
    methods, and they work together very well.
-   https://bitbucket.org/snippets/deeenes/LjL5R/good-fruchterman-reingold-layout -
    Sometimes it is difficult to plot a graph with nodes evenly spaced
    and avoiding overlaps. Here are some good parameters for the
    Fruchterman Reingold layout using qgraph but the resulted layout can
    be used with igraph (sadly in the recent version of R igraph the
    fr\_layout method does not handle these parameters hence we must
    calculate the layout with qgraph).
-   https://datastorm-open.github.io/visNetwork/ - Interactive, HTML and
    javascript based network visualization from R.
-   https://graph-tool.skewed.de/ - A high-performance graph library
    with Python interface.

    purely in Python, recently with more features and better
    visualization.
-   https://pygraphviz.github.io/ - Python interface for
    [graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/), the graph visualization
    library known from its greate layout algorithms.
-   http://kateto.net/network-visualization - In depth R network visualization
    tutorial including dynamic, interactive figures and animations, from
    Katya Ognyanova. Is worth to check out other nice materials [on the
    webpage.](http://kateto.net/)

## Other tools for graphics and typography: post processing figures, designing slides, posters and figures, typesetting reports, papers, theses and books

-   https://github.com/gztchan/awesome-design - A curated collection of
    graphic design resources from Tony Chan.
-   http://inkscape.org/ - Inkscape is a professional vector graphics
    editor and a free alternative of Adobe Illustrator. Its default
    format is standard SVG, while you can import and export many other
    formats, for example, of course PDF. Of note, you really should not
    pay \$240 per year for an application to a company only to design
    vector graphics. Nor should you make your institute pay it for you.
    This way you only chain yourself to Adobe and the more time and
    energy you invest in learning to use this sophisticated application
    it just constrain you to keep using it and keep paying for it.
    What's the point in this when an excellent free and open source
    alternative is available? Inkscape is powerful and what you learn
    and achieve using Inkscape remains yours forever.
-   http://gimp.org/ - GIMP stands for GNU Image Manipulation Program.
    Is a professional bitmap graphics editor and a free alternative of
    Adobe Photoshop. What I wrote about Inkscape and Illustrator as
    alternatives completely stands also for GIMP and Photoshop.
-   https://www.latex-project.org/ - LaTeX is the best tool and the
    state of the art standard for scientific typesetting and publishing.
    Created in the 80s by Leslie Lamport, and developed by the
    scientific community with the aim of having a tool which completely
    fits their needs. LaTeX is a free and open source software built on
    top of TeX which has been created by Donald Knuth also addressing
    the needs of scientific typography. The difference is that TeX does
    very basic elementary things in the background, like how to fill a
    line of text with symbols, while LaTeX provides macros for more
    complex tasks, like how to size and position items of a list or
    titles on a page in order to make it look good. I can not say LaTeX
    is an alternative of Adobe InDesign, but for scientific publishing
    it is definitely superior. You can of course use it for typesetting
    fiction books or entertaining journals, but maybe you will have more
    difficulties and if you just want an open source alternative for
    this, there is [Scribus](https://www.scribus.net/). If you need help
    with LaTeX don't go to [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
    but to [its sister site dedicated for
    LaTeX](https://tex.stackexchange.com/). One more important thing:
    you can not simply download and install LaTeX, it comes packaged in
    many different distributions, including different fonts, typesetting
    engines and macro packages. First you should look up which of these
    are available for your operating system. And many templates and
    styles are also available, for example journals used to have their
    own article style, universities their own presentation and thesis
    styles.
-   https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Beamer\_%28LaTeX%29 - Beamer is a LaTeX
    package for creating presentations. In my opinion for scientific
    presentations it is much better than PowerPoint and Keynote which
    are the most awful applications I have ever seen and I am really
    happy I could completely avoid them in the last 15 years. Also
    Beamer is a free and open source software. Most of the default
    themes look not very nice and old-style, but you can easily modify
    them to have something better looking. See examples
    [here](http://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/~matloff/beamer.html),
    [here](https://sites.google.com/a/wfu.edu/stevenwicker/tech-resources/latex),
    [here](http://deic.uab.es/~iblanes/beamer_gallery/index.html),
    [here](http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~frank/ENG/latex-course/latex-course-3/latex-course-3_en.html),
    [here](http://www.cs.ru.nl/~pim/beamer.php),
    [here](https://www.tjansson.dk/2008/01/presentations-with-latex-beamer-class-ku-style/),
    [here](http://hamaluik.com/posts/better-beamer-themes/) or
    [here](https://github.com/matze/mtheme). If you work at EMBL or in
    the Saez-Rodriguez Group at RWTH Aachen University you can find my
    Beamer theme, slightly modified from PaloAlto, in my git repos
    there: [@EMBL](https://git.embl.de/turei/embl-graphics) or
    [@Aachen](https://github.com/saezlab/graphics). Other notes: the
    final format of your slides will be PDF which is perfectly
    cross-platform. You should check or ask the tech support for the
    aspect ratio of the projector in your lecture room. Prepare
    wide-screen (16:9 or 16:10) slides if those fit as you can have more
    space this way. Also check if your connection can transmit this
    resolution and have an HDMI cable and adapter with you if necessary.
    VGA cables are sometimes limited to 4:3 aspect ratio and 1024x768
    resolution which is quite poor.
-   http://www.texstudio.org/ - TeXstudio is a great editor for LaTeX.
    It comes with autocompletion, built in help, embedded compilation
    tool, PDF viewer and many other handy tools.
-   http://gpick.org/ - Gpick is a nice little color picker and palette
    editor application for Linux by Albertas Vyšniauskas. I use it with
    great satisfaction to create palettes what I use later in R, Python,
    Inkscape, GIMP or whereever else. I don't know about alternatives
    for Mac or Windows but definitely there are.

### TikZ

-   http://www.texample.net/tikz/examples/ - PGF/TikZ is a LaTeX package
    for creating high quality scientific graphics authored by Till
    Tantau. To find out what kind of graphics, see [the examples in the
    galery](http://www.texample.net/tikz/examples/). If your figure
    involves lots of maths, algebra or needs many alignements and
    positioning TikZ might be useful for you. It is worth to take a
    look on the 1161 pages [user manual of
    TikZ](http://mirrors.ctan.org/graphics/pgf/base/doc/pgfmanual.pdf),
    it is really amazing! Or you can start with the [short

## IDEs (integrated development environments)

IDEs help you to keep track of files in your project, their history,
dependencies, testing, outputs, etc.

### Python IDEs

-   https://www.pythonanywhere.com/ - A full Python environment in the cloud
    with lots of [libraries](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/batteries_included/)
    and many Python versions available. You can write Python scripts in the
    browser, and even deploy your application as a webpage. Free plan is
    available.
-   https://www.yhat.com/products/rodeo - Python IDE similar to RStudio,
    focusing on data analysis.
-   https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/ - One of
    the best IDEs for python, with many tools and complex interface 
-   https://www.continuum.io/why-anaconda - Python environment intended for
    science and data analysis, with easy availability of relevant modules

### R IDEs

-   http://rstudio.com/ - Very popular and powerful IDE for R. Built in
    editor, file browser, shell, plot viewer, manual and many other
    helpful tools.

## Image processing

In biology computational analysis of images is often unavoidable. With
high-throughput microscopy you can acquire hundreds of images just in
one hour of time and obviously you can not do all the adjustments and
measurements by hand. Luckily there are a number of easy to use tools
around. You can identify structures and make measurements and finally
come to quantitative data from images. ImageJ is very popular and can
be programmed by its own macro language or many other languages including
Python. But if you want to use Python maybe better to go for Python
image processing modules like scikit-image, OpenCV or ITK.

-   [A comprehensive Introduction from Justin Bois](

    focusing on Macintosh but for sure many of them available also for other
    systems.

### Chemical typography

Here we list a couple of tools for high quality drawing of chemical formulae
and schema. A popular proprietary tool for this purpose is ChemDraw, however
it costs 600 (1 year) to 6,500 (unlimited) USD. There are a number of similar
design GUI free software available but I found them especially difficult to
use and lacking of essential features. One proprietary but free solution is
Marvin Sketch (see below). Some further software are for 3D drawing, among
these ``vimol`` is a nice piece (see below). However, as always in LaTeX you
can find high quality, free and full featured solutions. In addition, you
can draw structures from with OpenBabel or RDKit from any language they
support, including Python for this you need to create the structure or
download from a database.

-   https://github.com/ilyak/vimol - 3D chemical structure viewer and editor
    with vim-like interface from Ilya Kaliman. I really like this one, it's
    a shame it's not maintained or developed any more.
-   https://chemaxon.com/products/marvin - A free but proprietary 2D chemical
    structure editor from the ChemAxon company.
-   https://www.macinchem.org/reviews/python/pythonchem.php - Introduction
    to drawing with OpenBabel from Python.

-   https://www.slideshare.net/NextMoveSoftware/rdkit-ugm-2016-higher-quality-chemical-depictions -
    Comparison of RDKit, OpenBabel and some other chemical structure rendering

#### LaTeX

-   https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/52722/can-you-make-chemical-structure-diagrams-in-latex -
    For a general guidance please read both answers to this question. They
    give an overview of the alternatives with minimal examples and opinions.
-   http://xymtex.com/fujitas3/xymtex/indexe.html - XyMTeX is a software for
    drawing chemical formulae and schemata. Developed by an old professor in
    Japan, Shinsaku Fujita, it seems to be the ultimate "if something you
    can't do with this probably there is no way to do it" solution. XyMTeX
    is huge, it's manual is huge (780 pages!), it's features are countless
    and it's output is the highest quality. Of course as always, using such
    a great tool requires learning, and there are some smaller and simpler
    solutions available.
-   https://ctan.org/pkg/chemfig - Another great tool with good manual,
    actively maintained and maybe easier to ues than XyMTeX but maybe not so
    perfect drawings. By Christian Tellechea.
-   https://github.com/aminophen/chemobabel - Generates graphics within LaTeX
    directly from SMILES or ChemDraw files. Uses OpenBabel for rendering.

## Performance

Most of the times scripting languages like R and Python are provide sufficient
performance to run our tasks on our laptop, or and if that's not enough, we
can just go to the big computer cluster of the institute. The performance
intensive methods are often contained in extensions written in C or Fortran
and the scripting language is only the glue holding together our current
particular arrangement, adding easy access and flexibility to the efficient
core methods. However, you might find yourself in a situation when your code
much runs slower than ideal. Especially if you need a new, computationally
intensive method, not implemented yet in any package with bindings to your
scripting language. So what to do with performance issues?

### Profiling

The first thing you should do is profiling. In Python the cProfile module
is fantastic for this purpose. At the end you will get a hierarchic tree
of the method calls, with the number of calls and time spent for each method.
Based on this you can go back to the code and try to improve the methods
which mean a bottleneck, those which consume most of the time or called the
most often.

-   https://julien.danjou.info/guide-to-python-profiling-cprofile-concrete-case-carbonara/ - A guide about cProfile with a complete case study.

### Use efficient libraries

In the profiling you might have found out where are the slow parts in your
code. One of the most efficient ways to improve efficiency is to outsorce
intensive parts to extensions written in C or other high performance
language. Make sure especially that vectorizable operations are done by
numpy. Similarly, for graph computations igraph is an efficient C extension,
and for mass spec methods you can use OpenMS. And these are just two
examples, you should search for similar extensions for your method.

### Writing C extensions

If the sufficient performance can't be achieved due to limitations of the
scripting language, and no libraries are available, you can write the
computationally intensive parts in C++ and create the sufficient bindings.
It's especially easy to mix Python and C code with Cython or R and C++ with
Rcpp.

-   https://adv-r.hadley.nz/rcpp.html - Rcpp guide.

### Using Rust

Writing C or C++ code is difficult, and actually there are more convenient
and more modern alternatives available. One of them is Rust, a new languege
which became highly popular among programmers and gaining popularity also
in science.

## Regular expression resources

In data analysis we process tremendous amount of data which is sometimes
noisy and we need to extract information from messy patterns. Regular
expressions sooner or later will be your essential tools no matter which
field and language do you work with. Here are a few excellent resources
to learn these small tricky things called regex:
-   http://rexegg.com/ -
    great, detailful tutorials from beginner to advanced, often with
    interactive demo.
-   http://regular-expressions.info/ - maybe the most
    well known regex page, clear and concise.
-   http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2015/11/18/pythons-hidden-re-gems/ - about
    Python's regex module.

### sed, awk, grep

-   http://www.catonmat.net/series/sed-one-liners-explained - Good resource
    for learning `sed` (the *s*tream *ed*itor, a swiss army knife of the Unix
    shell). From Peter Krumin.
-   http://www.catonmat.net/blog/awk-one-liners-explained-part-one/ - `awk`
    one liners explained: `awk` is another poweful "swiss army knife" of the
    Unix shell. This guide is as good as the one about `sed`, also from Peter
    Krumin. `awk` got its name from the initials of its original authors:
    Alfred Aho, Peter Weinberg and Brian Kernighan.

## Collections, cheatsheets

-   https://devhints.io/ - Nicely designed cheatsheets for many tools, mostly
    web related, but quite some of them also used in data science. For
    example, xpath is used in a large number of XML processing tools, and on
    the cheatsheet you can quickly find the syntax elements you need:
    https://devhints.io/xpath.

## Unix, Linux and Bash

### Introductory Bash

Basic bash is essential whatever operating system you use. Linux and Mac
anyways has Bash as its default command line. It is extremely versatile and
convenient. You can have it also in Windows if you want, see the section
below. If you have access to any computing cluster or file storage server at
your institute or university, you most likely have the easiest (and often the
only) access to them by Bash.

There are so many Bash tutorials for beginners. I think most of them are quite
dry and you will get bored soon or forget soon what you read. I think aim to
learn the most essential 10-20 commands first, and keep using it actively for
many weeks. Then according to your needs you can learn more useful things and
what you read will be more digestable for you. Among the 3 materials below
maybe the first one is the best in style:

-   https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/
-   https://www.cs.sfu.ca/~ggbaker/reference/unix/
-   https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/

If you prefer to learn from podcasts and videos you can find a ton of them
on youtube, for example this channel covers many topics including Linux,
Bash, SSH, vim, etc:

-   https://www.youtube.com/user/nixiedoeslinux/videos

### SSH

SSH stands for secure shell and it gives you a bash session on a remote
computer (e.g. computing cluster of your institute), also capable to copy
files between your computer and the remote one (scp) and to encrypt any
communication between any software on different computers. It is convenient
to set up a key based authentication for the server so you don't need to
type your password any more:

## Virtual machines

If you use Unix-like system you most likely want to have a Windows virtual
machine (VM) and conversely, if you use Windows you most likely need a Linux
VM for the very few tasks which can not be performed but only with one of
these operating systems. Really you should not expect to have such tasks
often, most probably you will start your VM only once a month.

The easiest way to create virtual machines is VirtualBox which has a free
and open source edition, but the not OS edition is also free. It integrates
seemlessly with your main operating system (especially if you install also
the guest additions): you can share your directories, USB devices, network,
etc. If you switch the VM to full screen you will have exactly the same
experience as it was your main system.

## Windows

In my opinion by using Windows you make most of the things more difficult
for yourself because it is designed to restrict your insight and control
over the technology. This way you do many things blindly without understanding
what is happening in the background, and if you encounter a problem you will
have less information available for thinking about a solution. Still many
people use Windows because they feel they already invested significant time
into "learning" it in the school and they don't want to learn something new.

If you use Windows as your main operating system, you might want to have some
Unix compatible tools to make it more convenient to use. Alternatively
you might create a virtual machine with Linux. But in this case I think you
need a strong reason why you don't install Linux as your main system.

-   https://www.putty.org/ - A little SSH and Telnet client for Windows. The
    easiest way to log in to Unix servers (usually the computing clusters of
    your institute or university). Note: for an SSH login you need at least
    3 information: the address of the server, your user name and
    your password.
-   https://mingw-w64.org/ - GCC for Windows. You need this if you want to
    compile software using GCC.
-   https://www.cygwin.com/ - A POSIX compatible environment for Windows. You
    need this to have all the very helpful tools and environment you have by
    default on Linux. And also to run some software which need a POSIX
    environment.
-   https://gitforwindows.org/ - Git for Windows. I think an easy quick
    solution is to install only this, and it will offer for you to install
    also Cygwin and Bash, and set up your paths. At the end you will have
    a nice environment.

Alternatively you can use the "Windows Subsystem for Linux" or virtual
machines to use Linux from within Windows. But in this case why not to run
Linux and keep a Windows virtual machine for the rare cases when you might
need somthing from Windows.

-   https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about - Windows Subsystem for
    Linux is a compatibility layer from Microsoft to run Linux binaries in
    Windows.
-   https://www.virtualbox.org/ - With VirtualBox you can create virtual
    computers which are almost completely like real computers and you can
    install and run any operating system on them. They can be made full screen
    and integrate seemlessly to the desktop of your main (host) operating
    system. VirtualBox is very popular because is easy to use, has great
    features and is open source.

## Linux

    Linux system for data science purpuse? A guide from Patrick Schratz.
    Arch Linux is a highly customizable and efficient Linux distribution
    which requires advanced computer skills to configure and manage. But
    exactly because of this reason it's an excellent environment for learning
    more about Linux and computers in general.
